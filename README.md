This C++ program implements algorithms related to graph theory to solve a problem related to the connectivity of a kingdom. The main objectives are to find the minimum time required to travel between cities, the first year when mutual distances are achievable, the first year when the entire kingdom becomes reachable from the royal palace, and the minimum cost to build roads to achieve this connectivity.

Each input is composed of several lines. The first line contains two integers, N and M, representing, respectively, the number of villages and connections in Baiconia. It is guaranteed that the roads form paths connecting every pair of villages. You can assume that 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 106, and the villages are numbered with elements from the set {1, 2, ..., N}. Each of the following M lines describes a connection between a pair of villages and contains five integers u, v, a, l, c, where u and v are villages (1 ≤ u ≠ v ≤ N), a is the year of road construction (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^8), l represents the crossing time of the road (1 ≤ l ≤ 10^5), and c represents its construction cost (1 ≤ c ≤ 10^5). Assume that there are no other connections between villages and the start is year 0.

The output contains multiple lines. In the i-th of the first N lines, an integer should be printed representing the minimum time required to leave the royal palace and reach village i. On the N + 1-th line of the output, a single integer A1 should be printed, representing the first year in which the distances listed in the previous lines are mutually achievable. The N + 2-th line of the output contains a single integer A2, representing the first year from which it is possible to reach any village in the kingdom from the royal palace. Finally, on line N + 3, print a single integer representing the minimum cost required to connect the entire kingdom.

The output should be written to the standard output
